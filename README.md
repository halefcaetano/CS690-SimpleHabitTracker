## Future Enhancements

- **Cross-Platform Support**:  
  A suggestion was made to explore Xamarin SDK for cross-platform development.  
  While this is an interesting approach, this project currently focuses on a single-platform solution.  
  Future iterations might include a mobile version using Xamarin, React Native, or Flutter.
